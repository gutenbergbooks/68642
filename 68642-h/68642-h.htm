  <i>The Little White Gate</i><br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  <i>A gate is made for shutting, and that is always right,<br />
  But only when it's black, and brown, NEVER when it's white,<br />
  Never when it's white, dears, and very tiny too;<br />
  It always must be open for the fairies to slip through!</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>They choose a little white gate became it's clean and neat,<br />
  They sit upon the topmost bar and swing their fairy feet;<br />
  And if you say you love them they'll make a fairy din,<br />
  And open wide the little gate and simply pull you in!</i><br />

  <i>The First Lamb</i><br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Take a bit of woolly stuff,<br />
  Kiss it till it's warm enough,<br />
  Roll it up with play and fun,<br />
  That's a lamb&mdash;a little one!<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="firstshoot"></a>
  <i>The First Shoot</i><br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  He peeped up through the winter snow,<br />
  His little hands together&mdash;so,<br />
  I almost think I heard his prayer;<br />
  He did not know that I was there.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="bulbhouse"></a>
  <i>The Bulb House</i><br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The little bulb house is a house of brown,<br />
  Its doors are locked and its blinds are down<br />
  Winds may whistle and winds may creep,<br />
  The little brown house is a house of sleep.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But when the sun gives a golden knock<br />
  The blinds go up and the doors unlock.<br />
  The sleepy tenant will softly stir,<br />
  And throw off the garment that covers her.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And she will put on her dress with care,<br />
  A Hyacinth lady, tall and fair.<br />
  All this magic in scent and blue<br />
  You may buy in the shop for a copper or two!<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="godspictures"></a>
  <i>God's Pictures</i><br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  God keeps His pictures in the big Outside,<br />
  And some are narrow ones and some are wide.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I like His picture of the field the best,<br />
  With grass, and sky that meets it, and the rest<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Of very lovely things I cannot name&mdash;<br />
  The hawthorn hedge around it is the frame.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="yellow"></a>
  <i>Yellow</i><br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Of all the colours God has made<br />
  I love the pretty yellow shade&mdash;<br />
  The colour of canaries' wings,<br />
  Of baby ducks, and fluffy things;<br />
  I think He must have spilt the sun<br />
  Upon the darlings, every one!<br />
</p>

<a id="greygirl"></a>
  Grey Girl<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  A little Grey Girl in a little Grey Cloak<br />
  Came over the hill by the lane&mdash;<br />
  She carried a bundle which suddenly broke.<br />
  "Oh, dear," cried the Girl in the little Grey Cloak,<br />
  "I am losing my beautiful rain!"<br />

<h3>

  <i>Buttercup Gold</i><br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  There are rich little boys in the big, wide world,<br />
  And rich little girls, I'm told.<br />
  But the poorest child is the richest child<br />
  If he gathers Buttercup gold.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  God puts it out in the grassy fields<br />
  For anyone passing there.<br />
  Come, gather the Buttercup gold with me,<br />
  There's more than enough to spare!<br />

</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Have you seen the gold in the Green Bank of England?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonderful, beautiful, lovely to behold&mdash;<br />
  Aconite and coltsfoot, buttercup and daffodil,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crocus and celandine, and dandelion bold!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Have you found the gold in the Green Bank of England?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may go and take it&mdash;none of it is sold.<br />
  Gorse, broom, and ragwort, bedstraw and cowslip,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kingcup and pansy, and silver-weed gold.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Yours is the gold in the Green Bank of England,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours for the asking&mdash;treasury untold;<br />
  Potentilla, primrose, yellow vetch, and trefoil,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pimpernel and hawkweed, and pussy-willow gold.<br />

  <i>A Day</i><br />

<p class="poem">
  Morning came to Baby, her feet all wet with dew,<br />
  Her hair was yellow sunshine, her eyes were skyey blue,<br />
  And she said, "Wake up, my darling, I have brought a day for you."<br />

  Some red, red earth and a hawthorn hedge,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a dear little round front door;<br />
  A nibble, nibble, along the edge,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one little nibble more.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A whispering rustle in yellow wheat,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clink of a milking-pail,<br />
  And a sudden scamper of furry feet,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bob of a little white tail.<br />

  <i>Leap Year</i><br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Froggie hopped the other day<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very, very high;<br />
  Mrs Frog said, "Well, I never,<br />
  Didn't know you were so clever,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell the reason why!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Froggie gave another hop,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winked his little eye&mdash;<br />
  "As the year is Leap Year, Mother,<br />
  I can really do no other&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the reason why!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="songs"></a>
  <i>Songs of the Pine-wood</i><br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  There was a little seaside breeze who loved to dance and play;<br />
  He'd rush along the yellow sands and fly across the bay;<br />
  And when the frothy billows began to sway and roll,<br />
  He'd find the highest seaweed rock and rest his little soul.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But other breezes came along, ten thousand and a score;<br />
  They pushed and jostled all the day upon the sea and shore;<br />
  And little breeze got weary of rough and noisy play,<br />
  Said he, "I'll find another home&mdash;it's time I went away."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He spread his wings of silver light and flew across the foam,<br />
  And in a wood of scented pines he found his little home.<br />
  So, if you stop and listen, you'll hear the little breeze<br />
  As he sings his sweet sea-music in the branches of the trees.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun comes peeping<br />
  Baby Poppy wakes herself,<br />
  Twists herself and shakes herself,<br />
  Throws aside her greeny bonnet<br />
  With the silver down upon it,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says good-bye to sleeping<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun comes peeping.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bees come wooing<br />
  Lady Poppy crowns herself,<br />
  Nods her head and gowns herself<br />
  In the prettiest of dresses,<br />
  Scarlet crinkled frillinesses,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knows what she is doing<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bees come wooing.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wind comes calling<br />
  Mother Poppy shakes herself,<br />
  Brown and crinkled makes herself,<br />
  Opens little windows wide,<br />
  Drops her babies down outside,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees them softly falling<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wind comes calling.<br />

<p class="poem">
  There is a bird bath on our grass,<br />
  I wait to watch it as I pass,<br />
  And see the little sparrow things<br />
  Stand on the edge with flapping wings.<br />
  They give each eye a merry wink<br />
  And stoop to take a little drink,<br />
  And then, before I'm fairly gone,<br />
  They bath with all their clothing on!<br />

<p class="poem">
  The fairies live in Hyde Park&mdash;the London ones, I mean;<br />
  They love to see the blue sky and feel a bit of green;<br />
  They look out for the children, and beckon as they pass,<br />
  And fix up fairy notices, "Please keep ON the grass."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The fairies live in Hyde Park because they love to hide;<br />
  They tell the roar of London Town to keep itself outside,<br />
  For there are all the furry things, the birds and woolly lambs,<br />
  And little new-born fairy-folk asleep inside their prams.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The fairies live in Hyde Park, and in the month of March<br />
  A little girl comes riding underneath the Marble Arch;<br />
  She goes by way of Hyde Park, the fairies say she can&mdash;<br />
  A busy little Wendy girl, to stay with Peter Pan.<br />

  A fairy heard him crying there,<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  She fixed it on&mdash;her dainty wing&mdash;<br />

  Fairy Frilly for half an hour<br />
  Went to sleep in a poppy flower&mdash;<br />
  Went to sleep in her little green frock,<br />

  Quarter to ten and five to ten<br />
  Ticked from the dandelion clock again,<br />

  <i>And ten was the time of the fairy ball!</i><br />

  Little West Wind came by that way,<br />

  And found that she had lost her way.<br />
  "Oh, dear," she cried, "what shall I do,<br />
  I promised I'd be in by two!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now Brother Snail was passing by;<br />
  He heard the little fairy cry;<br />
  He stopped awhile and then turned back,<br />

  <i>When Fairies have a Picnic</i><br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  When fairies have a picnic they always tidy up;<br />
  It would be a disgraceful thing to leave a broken cup.<br />
  They roll up bits of paper, and hide the orange-skin,<br />
  And find a most convenient hole to put the rubbish in!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When fairies have a picnic they see the fire is out,<br />
  For fear that Brother Wind may come and scatter it about.<br />
  They leave a pile of brushwood, as that is nice and dry,<br />
  For other picnic people who are certain to pass by!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When fairies have a picnic they never break the trees,<br />
  They smooth the grass and daisy-buds as gently as you please,<br />
  And packing up their baskets they softly steal away,<br />
  And leave the place all beautiful for some one else to play!<br />

  Sit upon this mossy stone&mdash;<br />
  Play on, fairy gramophone!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sweet the fairy records are,<br />
  Sun, and moon, and twinkling star,<br />
  Winds that call and streams that rush,<br />
  Song of Tit, and Brother Thrush,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I have my tea.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watches more and more&mdash;<br />

  His eyes are very big and brown,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hair is soft and bright;<br />
  But I am sure he's ill, because<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face is thin and white.<br />
  He never walks a single step,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I'm sure he's four&mdash;<br />
  His nursie always carries him&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy next door!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sometimes he waves his hand to me<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beckons me&mdash;like this:<br />
  And I just climb up on my chair<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blow him back a kiss.<br />
  He loves to watch the sunbeams dance,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or great big raindrops pour;<br />
  And every tiny birdie knows<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy next door!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But yesterday&mdash;I can't forget&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood up in my chair<br />
  To beckon to the little boy;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, oh! he wasn't there.<br />
  And Nursie said he'd gone away&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wouldn't tell me more&mdash;<br />
  I wonder if he thinks of me&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy next door!<br />

  Belinda's hair is golden, her eyes a lovely blue,<br />

  Eliza's hair is browny, one eye has gone away,<br />
  She has a flannel nighty and wears it all the day,<br />
  Her face is scratched and battered, just like our wat'ring-can;<br />
  She's not Belinda Bella, but just Eliza Ann.<br />

  I know Belinda Bella is beautiful to see,<br />

  <i>The Pixies on the Moor</i><br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Come, my little darling, and shut the oaken door,<br />
  This is the time when Pixie-folk are peeking on the moor;<br />
  They're very naughty Pixie-folk, and up to awful tricks,<br />
  So shut the door, my darling, for the clock is striking six.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They steal the milk from Cushy-cow, they suck the bantam's eggs,<br />
  They harry all the mother sheep, and run them off their legs;<br />
  They sip the cream from out the pans, and leave it thin and poor,<br />
  So 'ware the naughty Pixie-folk that peek upon the moor.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They sit upon the handle when Nanette is at the churn,<br />
  And, lo, when she has worked for hours the butter will not 'turn';<br />
  And once when she was in the field they came along to stare,<br />
  They pulled her apron-strings undone, and left her standing there.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They steal the new-born lambs, they do, and lure the foals away,<br />
  They play their tricks in mowing-fields, and trample new-mown hay;<br />
  They worry girls on market-day, as cheeky as can be,<br />
  And once they mixed a pound of rice in Aunt Eliza's tea.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And once there was a traveller upon the lonesome wild,<br />
  He left his horse because he heard the crying of a child;<br />
  He found he was mistaken, and then, alack-a-day,<br />
  He saw the Pixies on his horse a-galloping away.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And once there was a naughty girl who stole her mother's jam,<br />
  She said she didn't do it, and she blamed it on to Sam;<br />
  The Pixie-folk were passing, on their journey to the South,<br />
  They tied her hands behind her back and plastered up her mouth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And once again a cruel boy was breaking up a nest,<br />
  He turned the baby robins out and wouldn't let them rest;<br />
  The Pixies came and chased him far, and left him in a bog,<br />
  They splashed the mud upon his face and wrapped him in a fog.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So when I come to think of it, the Pixies aren't all bad,<br />
  And if they punish naughty folk, why, then I'm very glad,<br />
  But I am still afraid of them and all their funny tricks,<br />
  So shut the door, my darling, for the clock is striking six.<br />

  <i>Jerry</i><br />
</h3>

<p class="t3">
  <i>The True Story of a Little Boy who Ran Away</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Jerry was sick of school and play,<br />
  So Jerry determined to run away;<br />
  He made a pack from an ancient sack,<br />
  And fastened it on to his strong young back.<br />
  A frying-pan and a kettle of tin,<br />
  A boot-box to keep his rations in.<br />
  Sing ho! for adventure, bold and merry,<br />
  There's none so brave in the world as Jerry.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Jerry's face was a great big smile<br />
  When he found himself at the second mile;<br />
  But he couldn't hurry the way he ought,<br />
  For the road was long and Jerry was short.<br />
  And the awkward pack was loose and slack,<br />
  And bobbed and rattled across his back;<br />
  Sing ho! for adventure, bold and merry,<br />
  There's none so brave in the world as Jerry.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The dust of the road was upon his face<br />
  When Jerry came to his camping-place;<br />
  A bush of gorse and a hawthorn-tree,<br />
  A glimpse of the far-off restless sea,<br />
  A broken boulder, and there, oh, joy!<br />
  A cave the size of a little boy.<br />
  Sing ho! for adventure, bold and merry,<br />
  There's none so brave in the world as Jerry.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The cave was found to be dark and damp,<br />
  So Jerry arranged for an outside camp;<br />
  He lit a fire and made him tea,<br />
  And drank it under the hawthorn-tree.<br />
  True it was queer and made him choke<br />
  (One part water and three parts smoke).<br />
  Sing ho! for adventure, bold and merry,<br />
  There's none so brave in the world as Jerry.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The day drew in as the night came by,<br />
  And thousands of stars shone in the sky.<br />
  "Squeak" went the bat and "Hoot" the owl,<br />
  And a farmhouse dog gave a long-drawn howl.<br />
  Jerry sat up and shivered and shook,<br />
  And peeped in the cave with a terrified look.<br />
  Sing ho! for adventure, bold and merry,<br />
  But there's none so scared in the world as Jerry.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What cared Jerry for camping-grounds<br />
  When night was giving her awful sounds?<br />
  What cared Jerry for kettle and pan?<br />
  Jerry took to his heels and ran,<br />
  Swift as an arrow from the bow,<br />
  Swift as a runner of long ago.<br />
  Sing ho! for adventure, bold and merry,<br />
  There's none so scared in the world as Jerry.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In at the little well-worn gate,<br />
  Just as the clock was striking eight.<br />
  Jerry who ran away, it's plain,<br />
  Was Jerry who ran right home again!<br />
  And Mother, who knew a thing or two,<br />
  Knew how to keep a secret true.<br />
  Sing ho! for adventure, bold and merry,<br />
  There's none so glad in the world as Jerry.<br />

<p class="poem">
  The toys in the cupboard were terribly angry,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The toys in the cupboard were mad as could be,<br />

<p class="poem">
  Said Doll, "It's disgraceful, I shall not endure it,<br />

  Said Horse, "Here's a pickle, I sat on Eliza,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't get it out, and it pricks like a pin."<br />

<p class="poem">
  Said Cow, "It is shocking, my horn's in the trumpet,<br />

<p class="poem">
  When Patty came in she was terribly frightened,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cupboard was moving about, she was sure,<br />
  She heard angry voices, "<i>It's perfectly awful,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's simply disgraceful&mdash;I cannot endure.</i>"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  She straightened the cupboard, put toys in their places,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She brushed out the Doll's hair, and smoothed down the Horse,<br />
  She took the soft tail of the Lamb from the teapot,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tenderly cared for the others, of course.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The toys in the cupboard were pleased and contented,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer they grumbled, no longer they wept,<br />

  I'm just a little pencil, but I have a busy day.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I really never am allowed to grow up as I ought,<br />
  I'm getting shorter every day (it's awful to be short),<br />
  And when the knife begins on me I ache in every joint,<br />
  I put it in that way because you're sure to see the point.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I'm very glad I'm useful, though my speech is always dark,<br />

  I am a little pencil, and my name is H and B,<br />

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
